A friend and I built a website for Duke students to buy and sell books. Previously, students were using a Facebook group to buy and sell books among students, which was cumbersome and inefficient. My friend and I decided to build a book exchange to make this transaction among students easier. A few features we included are:

- Using Google Book API to get book information like ISBN, authors, cover picture, etc by simply typing in the title
- Preloaded Duke classes so people can easily fill in the course information for a book
- A dashboard to track a user's transaction history
- Facebook integration to allow users to share on Facebook the books that they are currently selling on the exchange
- Duke login so only Duke students can login, preventing anyone from buying and selling books on the site
- Detailed email notifications when a user buys or sells
